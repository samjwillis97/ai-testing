# Task: Improve CLI Package Test Coverage

## Overview
Increase the test coverage of the CLI package to meet the project's coverage thresholds (80% for statements, functions, and lines) by implementing comprehensive tests for all components.

## Status
⏳ **IN PROGRESS** - May 1, 2025

## Background
The CLI package currently has insufficient test coverage (31.32% for statements and lines, 36.14% for functions), which falls well below the project's coverage thresholds of 80%. With the recent implementation of the `makeProgram()` utility function and test helpers, we now have a more reliable way to test CLI commands and functionality. This task aims to leverage these improvements to systematically increase test coverage across the CLI package.

## Requirements

1. ⬜ Improve Command Tests:
   - Direct Request Command: Currently at 12.13% line coverage
   - Collection Request Command: Currently at 18.91% line coverage
   - Completion Command: Currently at 34.32% line coverage
   - List Command: Currently at 95.67% line coverage (already good)

2. ⬜ Implement Plugin System Tests:
   - Plugin Manager: Currently at 19.9% line coverage
   - Plugin Initialization: Currently at 2.43% line coverage
   - Example Plugins: Currently at 0% coverage

3. ⬜ Implement Utility Tests:
   - Completion Utility: Currently at 3.57% line coverage
   - Config Utility: Currently at 2% line coverage
   - Output Utility: Currently at 90.2% line coverage (already good)
   - Program Utility: Currently at 65.81% line coverage (needs improvement)

4. ⬜ Implement Core CLI Tests:
   - Main Entry Point: Currently at 0% line coverage
   - Silent Wrapper: Currently at 0% line coverage

5. ⬜ Implement Integration Tests:
   - End-to-end tests for common CLI workflows
   - Tests for plugin integration with CLI commands
   - Tests for error handling and edge cases

## Implementation Details

### Testing Approach
- Use the new `makeProgram()` utility and test helpers for consistent test setup
- Focus on unit tests for individual components
- Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Use mocking to isolate components and test specific behaviors
- Follow a consistent testing pattern across all components

### Test Value Principles
- **Behavior over implementation**: Test what the code does, not how it does it
- **Edge cases**: Prioritize testing edge cases and error handling
- **Mocking dependencies**: Use mocks to isolate components and test specific behaviors
- **Realistic scenarios**: Create tests that reflect real-world usage patterns
- **Minimal redundancy**: Avoid testing the same behavior multiple times
- **Maintainability**: Write tests that are easy to understand and maintain

### Example Test Cases

#### Command Tests

**Direct Request Command**
```bash
# Basic HTTP GET request
$ shc get https://api.example.com/users
# Expected: Successfully fetches and displays user data in JSON format

# GET request with headers and query parameters
$ shc get https://api.example.com/users -H "Accept:application/json" -q "active=true" -q "role=admin"
# Expected: Adds headers and query parameters to the request

# Expected: Displays response in YAML format

# Handling request errors
$ shc get https://api.example.com/invalid-endpoint
# Expected: Shows appropriate error message with status code
```

**Collection Request Command**
```bash
# List available collections
$ shc list collections
# Expected: Displays list of available collections

# List requests in a collection
$ shc list requests my-collection
# Expected: Shows all requests in the specified collection

# Execute a request from a collection
$ shc my-collection get-users
# Expected: Executes the "get-users" request from "my-collection"

# Execute with environment variables
$ shc -V "api.baseUrl=https://staging.example.com" my-collection get-users
# Expected: Uses the specified base URL for the request

# Execute with modified request parameters
$ shc my-collection get-users -q "limit=50"
# Expected: Adds/overrides query parameters in the stored request
```

#### Plugin Tests

**Plugin Commands and Features**
```bash
# Load and use a custom command plugin
$ shc help-more
# Expected: Shows extended help information from the example plugin

# Use a custom output formatter plugin
$ shc get https://api.example.com/users -o html
# Expected: Formats the response as HTML using the custom formatter plugin

# Use a response visualizer plugin
$ shc get https://api.example.com/metrics -o chart
# Expected: Visualizes the response data as a chart

# Plugin configuration
$ shc -c "./config-with-plugins.yaml" get https://api.example.com/users
# Expected: Loads and uses plugins specified in the config file
```

#### Utility Tests

**Configuration and Options**
```bash
# Use custom configuration file
$ shc -c "./custom-config.yaml" get https://api.example.com/users
# Expected: Uses settings from the custom config file

# Override config with command line options
$ shc -c "./config.yaml" -V "api.timeout=5000" get https://api.example.com/users
# Expected: Uses timeout value from command line, not config file

# Use environment variables
$ SHC_API_BASEURL=https://staging.example.com shc get /users
# Expected: Uses base URL from environment variable
```

#### Integration Tests

**End-to-End Workflows**
```bash
# Workflow with plugin: use custom formatter for output
$ shc get https://api.example.com/users -o table
# Expected: Displays response as a formatted table

# Pipeline workflow: use output of one command as input to another
$ shc get https://api.example.com/users | jq '.[] | select(.active==true)'
# Expected: Pipes JSON output to jq for filtering
```

## Testing Strategies

### Ensuring High-Value Tests

1. **Focus on Critical Paths**
   - Prioritize testing the most commonly used functionality
   - Ensure core features have comprehensive test coverage
   - Test error handling for critical operations

2. **Use Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**
   - Clearly separate test setup, execution, and verification
   - Make tests readable and maintainable
   - Document the purpose of each test section with comments

3. **Minimize Mocking**
   - **Only mock Axios HTTP calls to guarantee responses**
   - Use real config files from the repo whenever possible
   - Create additional config files for specific test cases if necessary
   - Do not mock internal functions, file system operations, or other components
   - Prefer integration-style tests that test multiple components together

4. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Test with empty inputs, invalid inputs, and boundary conditions
   - Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Test with unexpected or malformed data

5. **Follow TypeScript Best Practices**
   - Ensure proper typing for all test variables and mocks
   - Use type assertions judiciously and only when necessary
   - Leverage TypeScript's type system to catch errors at compile time

6. **Maintain Test Quality**
   - Run linters on test code to ensure quality
   - Format test files consistently using prettier
   - Follow the project's code quality rules for tests

### Avoiding Low-Value Tests

1. **Avoid Implementation Details**
   - Test behavior, not implementation details
   - Don't test private methods directly
   - Don't couple tests to specific implementation approaches

2. **Minimize Redundancy**
   - Don't test the same behavior multiple times
   - Use parameterized tests for similar scenarios
   - Focus on unique behaviors and edge cases

3. **Avoid Brittle Tests**
   - Don't rely on specific output formats unless testing formatters
   - Use flexible matchers like `expect.objectContaining()`
   - Avoid hardcoding expected values that might change

4. **Don't Test External Libraries**
   - Focus on testing our code, not third-party libraries
   - Mock external dependencies rather than testing their behavior
   - Test integration points, not the libraries themselves

5. **Avoid Excessive Mocking**
   - Excessive mocks create tests that don't reflect real-world usage
   - Tests with too many mocks often test the mocks, not the actual code
   - Mocking too many internal components can hide real issues

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Command Tests with Real Configs**
   - Use existing config files in the repo for testing
   - Create minimal test fixtures for specific test cases
   - Focus on testing command behavior with real inputs and outputs
   - Only mock Axios HTTP calls when necessary

2. **Phase 2: Plugin Tests**
   - Implement tests for plugin manager
   - Implement tests for plugin initialization
   - Implement tests for example plugins
   - Test plugin integration with CLI commands

3. **Phase 3: Utility Tests**
   - Implement tests for collections utility
   - Implement tests for completion utility
   - Implement tests for config utility
   - Enhance tests for program utility

4. **Phase 4: Core and Integration Tests**
   - Enhance tests for main entry point
   - Implement tests for silent wrapper
   - Create integration tests for end-to-end workflows
   - Test error handling and edge cases

## Acceptance Criteria
