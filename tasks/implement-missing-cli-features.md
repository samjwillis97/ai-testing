# Task: Implement Missing CLI Features According to Specification

## Overview
Align the CLI package implementation with the CLI interface specification by implementing missing features and ensuring consistency between the specification and implementation.

## Status
⏳ **PENDING** - April 30, 2025

## Background
An analysis of the CLI package implementation against the CLI interface specification revealed several discrepancies and missing features. The current implementation provides a solid foundation but lacks some of the features described in the specification, has additional features not mentioned in the specification, and has some structural differences.

## Requirements

1. ⬜ Align Command Structure and Global Options:
   - Implement `-o, --output <format>` as a global option
   - Review and align the command structure with the specification

2. ⬜ Enhance Output Formats:
   - Implement all specified output formats: JSON, YAML, Raw, Table
   - Add support for custom formats via plugins

3. ⬜ Complete Autocomplete & Tab Completion:
   - Enhance the current basic implementation to support all features described in the specification
   - Implement multi-level completion
   - Ensure compatibility with bash, zsh, and fish shells

4. ⬜ Implement Integration Features:
   - Add pipe support (stdin/stdout)
   - Complete shell completion implementation
   - Ensure proper handling of environment variables

5. ⬜ Enhance Extension Support:
   - Implement comprehensive plugin architecture for:
     - Custom commands
     - Output formatters
     - Authentication providers
     - Request transformers
     - Response handlers

6. ⬜ Update Documentation:
   - Update the specification if any implementation differences are intentional
   - Document any additional features added in the implementation

## Implementation Details

### Files to Update in CLI Package
- `/packages/cli/src/index.ts`: 
  - Update global options to match specification
  - Ensure proper command structure

- `/packages/cli/src/utils/output.ts`:
  - Implement all output formats specified
  - Add plugin support for custom formats

- `/packages/cli/src/commands/completion.ts`:
  - Enhance tab completion implementation
  - Add support for multi-level completion

- `/packages/cli/src/utils/plugins.ts` (create if not exists):
  - Implement plugin architecture for extensions

### Testing
- Create tests for all new and enhanced features
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- ⬜ All features described in the CLI interface specification are implemented
- ⬜ Command structure and options match the specification
- ⬜ All output formats work correctly
- ⬜ Tab completion works as described in the specification
- ⬜ Plugin architecture supports all specified extension points
- ⬜ All tests pass with good coverage
- ⬜ Documentation is updated to reflect the current implementation

## Priority
Medium - This task ensures that the CLI package fully implements the features described in the specification, providing a consistent and complete user experience.

## Notes
- Some features in the current implementation that are not in the specification (like `--export`, `--import`, and `--save` options) should be evaluated to determine if they should be kept and added to the specification.
- The implementation adds several UX improvements (spinners, colors, tables) not detailed in the spec, which should be preserved and documented.
   - When using raw format there should be no additional formatting or UX improvements
- Consider whether the hierarchical command structure in the implementation is preferable to the flatter structure implied in the specification.
