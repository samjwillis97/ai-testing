# Task: Refactor CLI Collection Management

## Overview
Refactor the CLI's collection management to simplify the flow, reduce redundant operations, and improve performance by implementing proper singleton patterns and caching mechanisms.

## Status
⏳ **PENDING** - May 8, 2025

## Background
The current implementation of collection management in the CLI package has several issues:
- Redundant configuration loading
- Multiple instances of ConfigManager being created
- Excessive debug logging
- Unclear separation of concerns
- Inefficient function calls and duplicated logic
- Collections being loaded multiple times during command execution

These issues cause performance problems and make the code difficult to maintain and understand.

## Requirements

1. ⬜️ Implement proper singleton pattern for ConfigManager:
   - Create a single ConfigManager instance that's shared throughout the application
   - Use dependency injection to pass this instance to components that need it
   - Add caching mechanism to avoid reloading collections

2. ⬜️ Simplify the collection management flow:
   - Remove redundant functions like `getRequests` when they're not needed
   - Consolidate functionality into fewer, more focused functions
   - Ensure each function has a clear, single responsibility
   - Create helper functions for common operations

3. ⬜️ Streamline request execution:
   - Simplify the request execution flow
   - Remove redundant steps in the process
   - Handle edge cases properly

4. ⬜️ Update tests:
   - Ensure all tests pass with the new implementation
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update mocks as needed

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Update

- `/packages/core/src/config-manager.ts`:
  - Add caching mechanism for collections
  - Improve error handling
  - Remove debug logging

- `/packages/cli/src/utils/config.ts`:
  - Implement singleton pattern for ConfigManager
  - Create a shared instance that can be used throughout the application

- `/packages/cli/src/utils/collections.ts`:
  - Simplify collection management functions
  - Remove redundant functions
  - Implement helper functions for common operations
  - Improve error handling

- `/packages/cli/src/commands/collection-request.ts`:
  - Update to use the shared ConfigManager instance
  - Simplify request execution flow
  - Improve error handling and user feedback

## Expected Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Reduced redundant operations and proper caching
2. **Better Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns and focused functions
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify
4. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Consolidated functionality and helper functions
5. **Better User Experience**: More consistent error handling and feedback

## Dependencies
- None

## Notes
- This refactoring should not change the external API or user experience
- All existing functionality should continue to work as expected
- The focus is on internal improvements to the codebase
