Study SPECS.md and specs/* for functional specifications.

Run tests with: `pnpm run test:coverage`
Run linter with: `pnpm run lint`
Run type checker with: `pnpm run typecheck`
Run formatter with: `pnpm run prettier:fix`
Build with: `pnpm run build`

IMPORTANT: If any of the tests, lint checks or type checks fail, fix the issues before moving on. 

Study IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md and implement the most important piece (ensure tests are authored) if it has not been implemented.

Implement what is not implemented

IMPORTANT: After each change run tests, linter, type checker, formatter and build. If any of the tests, lint checks or type checks fail, fix the issues before moving on. After each change update the IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md file, run `pnpm run prettier:fix` and create a commit.
