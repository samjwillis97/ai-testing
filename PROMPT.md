Study SPECS.md and specs/* for functional specifications.
Implement what is not implemented

Study IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md and implement the most important piece (ensure tests are authored) if it has not been implemented.

After each change run the tests, resolve any failing tests, and build the application. Once completed update the IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md file, and create a commit.
