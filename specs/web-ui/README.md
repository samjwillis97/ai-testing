# Web UI Package (@shc/web-ui) Specification

## Overview

The Web UI package provides a modern, feature-rich interface for managing and executing HTTP requests. Built on top of @shc/core, it offers a comprehensive user interface for working with HTTP requests, collections, and responses.

## Specification Documents

- [UI Components](./components.md) - Detailed specification of the user interface components
- [Core Integration](./integration.md) - How the Web UI integrates with the Core package

## Core Features

### Request Management Interface

- Visual request builder
- Collection management
- Real-time request preview
- Response visualization
- Request history tracking
- Workspace management

### Collection Editor

- Tree-based collection navigation
- YAML/JSON import/export
- Collection version control
- Environment configuration UI
- Variable management interface
- Authentication setup wizard

### Request Builder Components

- Method selector with descriptions
- URL builder with validation
- Dynamic base URL support
- Header management interface
- Query parameter builder
- Request body editor:
  - JSON editor with validation
  - Form-data builder
  - Raw text editor
  - File upload support

## Core Integration

### Responsibility Boundaries

The Web UI package **must not** re-implement functionality that belongs to the core package, including:

- Configuration reading, parsing, or handling
- Variable sets management or resolution
- Plugin system core implementation
- Template resolution or substitution
- Collection data structure or management
- HTTP client implementation

Instead, the Web UI package should use the APIs provided by the core package for these features.

### Web UI-Specific Plugin Handling

The only exception to the above rule is for web-specific UI plugins that are exclusively relevant to the web interface. These plugins should:

- Still use the core plugin system architecture
- Only implement UI/visualization aspects specific to the web interface
- Not duplicate any core functionality

## Dependencies

- @shc/core: Core HTTP client and extension system
- React + React DOM
- TypeScript
- Vite (build tool)
- TailwindCSS (styling)
- CodeMirror (code editing)
- React Query (data fetching)

## Implementation Requirements

All implementations must follow the TypeScript best practices as defined in the project rules, including:

- Proper typing for all functions and methods
- Appropriate error handling
- Consistent async/await patterns
- Proper use of generics and type constraints
- Comprehensive test coverage
