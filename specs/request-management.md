# Request Management Specification

## Overview

Comprehensive system for saving, organizing, and managing HTTP requests across different projects and environments.

## Collection File Format

Collections are stored in YAML or JSON format, providing a standardized structure for organizing API requests and their configurations.

### Structure

```yaml
name: API Collection Name
version: 1.0.0

# Base URL for all requests in this collection
base_url: 'https://api.example.com'

# Variable set configuration
# See configuration.md for detailed variable sets documentation
variable_sets:
  - name: user
    description: "User information for requests"
    defaultValue: "john"
    activeValue: "john"
    values:
      john:
        firstName: "John"
        lastName: "Doe"
        email: "john@example.com"
      jane:
        firstName: "Jane"
        lastName: "Smith"
        email: "jane@example.com"

# Override global variable sets at collection level
variable_set_overrides:
  api: "staging"
  auth: "admin"

# Authentication configuration
authentication:
  type: bearer
  token: "${variables.auth.token}"

# Requests in this collection
requests:
  - id: get-user-profile
    name: Get User Profile
    description: "Retrieve the current user's profile"
    method: GET
    path: '/users/profile'
    headers:
      Accept: 'application/json'
      Authorization: 'Bearer ${variables.auth.token}'
      X-User-Email: '${variables.user.email}'
    query:
      debug: '${variables.api.debug}'
```
