# Request Management Specification

This directory contains specifications for the request management system used by the SHC client.

## Specification Files

- [**Collection Format**](./collection-format.md): Structure and format of collection files
- [**Request Storage**](./request-storage.md): Storage and organization of request collections
- [**Request Execution**](./request-execution.md): Execution flow and lifecycle of requests

## Overview

The request management system provides a comprehensive way to save, organize, and manage HTTP requests across different projects and environments. It supports:

1. Hierarchical organization of requests in collections
2. Version control and sharing of collections
3. Environment-specific request configurations
4. Request templates and inheritance
5. Request history and favorites

## Collection Structure

Collections are organized in a hierarchical structure:

```
Collection
├── Folders
│   ├── Requests
│   └── Subfolders
└── Requests
```

Each collection can contain folders and requests, and folders can contain subfolders and requests, allowing for flexible organization of API endpoints.

## Request Lifecycle

The request lifecycle includes:

1. **Creation**: Creating a new request manually or from a template
2. **Configuration**: Setting request parameters, headers, body, etc.
3. **Execution**: Sending the request to the server
4. **Response Handling**: Processing and displaying the response
5. **History**: Storing the request and response for future reference
6. **Sharing**: Exporting or sharing the request with others

## Integration

The request management system integrates with all SHC components:

1. **Core Package**: Uses the HTTP client for request execution
2. **Configuration**: Leverages environment variables and templates
3. **Plugins**: Applies plugins to requests and responses
4. **UI Interfaces**: Provides interfaces for managing requests

For detailed specifications of each component, see the individual specification files in this directory.
