# Neovim UI Package (@shc/neovim-ui) Specification

## Overview

The Neovim UI package provides a Neovim plugin interface for the SHC project, allowing users to execute HTTP requests, manage collections, and configure the application directly from within Neovim. Built on top of @shc/core, it offers a comprehensive set of features integrated seamlessly with the Neovim editor.

## Specification Documents

- [UI Components](./ui-components.md) - Detailed specification of the UI layout and components
- [Commands](./commands.md) - Specification of the command system
- [Integration](./integration.md) - How the Neovim UI integrates with the Core package
- [Configuration](./configuration.md) - Configuration options for the Neovim UI
- [Extensions](./extensions.md) - Extension system for the Neovim UI

## Core Features

### UI Components

- Request editor buffer
- Response viewer buffer
- Collection explorer
- Environment selector
- Variable editor
- Status line integration
- Floating windows for auxiliary information

### Command System

- Request execution commands
- Collection management commands
- Navigation commands
- Configuration commands
- Plugin management commands

### Core Integration

- HTTP client integration
- Configuration management
- Plugin system integration
- Collection management
- Template engine integration

#### Responsibility Boundaries

The Neovim UI package **must not** re-implement functionality that belongs to the core package, including:

- Configuration reading, parsing, or handling
- Variable sets management or resolution
- Plugin system core implementation
- Template resolution or substitution
- Collection data structure or management
- HTTP client implementation

Instead, the Neovim UI package should use the APIs provided by the core package for these features.

#### Neovim-Specific Plugin Handling

The only exception to the above rule is for Neovim-specific UI plugins that are exclusively relevant to the Neovim interface. These plugins should:

- Still use the core plugin system architecture
- Only implement UI/visualization aspects specific to the Neovim editor
- Not duplicate any core functionality

### Configuration

- Customizable key mappings
- Theming options
- Layout configuration
- Default behaviors
- Integration with Neovim settings

### Extension System

- Custom request handlers
- Response transformers
- UI extensions
- Command extensions
- Integration with other Neovim plugins

## Dependencies

- @shc/core: Core HTTP client and extension system
- Neovim: Editor platform
- Lua: Scripting language for Neovim plugins
- plenary.nvim: Utility functions for Neovim plugins
- nvim-web-devicons: Icons for UI elements
- telescope.nvim: Fuzzy finder integration (optional)

## Implementation Requirements

All implementations must follow the TypeScript best practices as defined in the project rules, including:

- Proper typing for all functions and methods
- Appropriate error handling
- Consistent async/await patterns
- Proper use of generics and type constraints
- Comprehensive test coverage

Additionally, Lua code should follow best practices for Neovim plugin development:

- Modular organization
- Proper error handling
- Efficient use of Neovim APIs
- Comprehensive documentation
- Compatibility with different Neovim versions
