# Core Package Functional Specification

## Purpose

The core package (@shc/core) serves as the foundation for the SHC ecosystem, providing essential functionality for HTTP request management, configuration, and extensibility. It is designed to be used by other packages in the monorepo, including the CLI, web UI, and Neovim UI.

## Key Features

### 1. HTTP Client

The HTTP client provides a robust and extensible interface for making HTTP requests. Key features include:

- Support for all standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS)
- Request and response interceptors
- Plugin-based extensibility
- Type-safe responses with TypeScript generics
- Comprehensive error handling
- Event-based monitoring
- Builder pattern for flexible client configuration

### 2. Configuration Management

The configuration system provides a flexible and type-safe way to manage application settings:

- Schema-based configuration validation using Zod
- Loading from multiple sources (YAML, JSON, environment variables)
- Secret management for sensitive values
- Dynamic template resolution
- Type-safe configuration access
- Hierarchical configuration with defaults
- Configuration merging and overrides

### 3. Plugin System

The plugin system enables extending the core functionality through a modular architecture:

- Support for multiple plugin types:
  - Request preprocessors
  - Response transformers
  - Authentication providers
- Dynamic plugin loading from various sources:
  - NPM packages
  - Local filesystem
  - Git repositories
- Plugin lifecycle management
- Configuration-based plugin registration
- Type-safe plugin interfaces
- Event-based plugin communication

### 4. Template Engine

The template engine provides dynamic value resolution in configuration and requests:

- Support for various template sources:
  - Environment variables
  - Configuration values
  - Secrets
  - Custom functions
- Nested template resolution
- Object template resolution
- Extensible function registration
- Type-safe template execution

### 5. Collection Management

The collection management system provides tools for organizing and managing HTTP requests:

- Collection storage and retrieval
- Variable set management
- Request execution with variable substitution
- Collection import/export
- Collection sharing
- Request history tracking

## Integration Points

The core package is designed to integrate with:

1. **CLI Package** - Provides the foundation for the command-line interface
2. **Web UI Package** - Serves as the backend for the web interface
3. **Neovim UI Package** - Enables Neovim integration
4. **Base Plugins** - Supports the standard plugin set

## Performance Requirements

The core package must meet the following performance criteria:

1. **Startup Time** - Minimal impact on application startup time
2. **Memory Usage** - Efficient memory usage with proper resource cleanup
3. **Request Performance** - Minimal overhead on HTTP requests
4. **Plugin Loading** - Efficient plugin loading with lazy initialization

## Compatibility Requirements

The core package must be compatible with:

1. **Node.js Versions** - Support for Node.js 16.x and later
2. **TypeScript Versions** - Support for TypeScript 4.5 and later
3. **Module Systems** - Dual support for ESM and CommonJS
4. **Platforms** - Cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Security Requirements

The core package must adhere to the following security practices:

1. **Secret Management** - Secure handling of sensitive information
2. **Plugin Sandboxing** - Controlled execution environment for plugins
3. **Input Validation** - Proper validation of all inputs
4. **Dependency Management** - Regular updates for security patches
5. **Authentication** - Secure implementation of authentication mechanisms
